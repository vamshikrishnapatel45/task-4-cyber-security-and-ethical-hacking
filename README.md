task 4 Completed — Exploitation & System Security | ApexPlanet Internship
I’ve completed Task 4 of my ApexPlanet Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking internship — focused on responsible exploitation and system security hardening.
Key activities and learnings:
🔎 Followed the full penetration testing workflow: Recon → Scanning → Exploitation → Post-exploitation → Reporting.
⚙️ Used Metasploit in a controlled lab to safely exploit known vulnerabilities on Metasploitable2 and obtained a reverse shell for demonstration purposes (evidence captured).
🔐 Practiced post-exploitation commands to gather system info, enumerate users, and demonstrate safe artifact collection.
🔍 Performed password attacks (Hydra) and password cracking (John the Ripper) on captured hashes to understand weak credential risks.
🛡️ Demonstrated system hardening: applied patches, disabled unnecessary services, and configured firewall rules (iptables/ufw) to block attack vectors.
🎣 Built a phishing awareness simulation (educational only) and discussed user training as a mitigation.
All findings, screenshots, Metasploit logs, and mitigation recommendations are documented in my GitHub repo. This task strengthened my real-world understanding of how attackers move from initial access to persistence — and what defenders must do <img width="1741" height="951" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-07 165322" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98cc1c1e-ea06-4588-9ff4-0fbbf494cc13" />
